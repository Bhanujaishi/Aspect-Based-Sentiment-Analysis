Introduction 
‘A Baker from Goa’ revolves around the relevance of a baker in the
 
 
 
 
Goan culture which dates back to the time when Portuguese ruled
 
 
over the city of Goa. The Portuguese may have left but the
bread-makers continue to have an inevitable stature. In this story,
 
the author recalls his childhood days and their excitement on
 
 
seeing the baker. They were enthusiastic to the point that they
 
would run to him as soon as they woke up without even brushing
 
their teeth. 
   
  
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

Lesson & Explanation 
Our elders are often heard reminiscing nostalgically about those
 
good old Portuguese days, the Portuguese and their famous loaves
 
of bread. Those eaters of loaves might have vanished but the
 
makers are still there. We still have amongst us the mixers, the
 
 
moulders and those who bake the loaves. Those age-old,
timetested furnaces still exist. The fire in the furnaces has not yet
 
 
been extinguished. The thud and jingle of the traditional baker’s
bamboo, heralding his arrival in the morning, can still be heard in
 
 
 
some places. Maybe the father is not alive but the son still carries
on the family profession. These bakers are, even today, known as
 
 
pader in Goa. 
 ​Reminiscing nostalgically- thinking fondly of the past 
Loaves- (plural form of loaf) bread that is shaped and baked in a 
single piece and can be sliced for eating 
Vanished- disappear suddenly and completely 
Moulders- a person who moulds dough into a shape 
Furnaces- an enclosed structure in which materials can be heated 
to very high temperatures 
Extinguished- cause a fire to cease to burn 
Heralding- announcing 
Pader- word for baker in Portuguese language 
 
During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend,
 
companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day. Once,
 
when he set out in the morning on his selling round, and then again,
 
when he returned after emptying his huge basket. The jingling thud
 
of his bamboo woke us up from sleep and we ran to meet and greet
 
him. Why was it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all.

loaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant
 
of the house! What we longed for were those bread-bangles which
 
we chose carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of special make.

The baker made his musical entry on the scene with the ‘jhang,
 
jhang’ sound of his specially made bamboo staff. One hand
 
supported the basket on his head and the other banged the bamboo
 
on the ground. He would greet the lady of the house with “Good
 
morning” and then place his basket on the vertical bamboo. We kids
 
 
would be pushed aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be
delivered to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb
 
 
a bench or the parapet and peep into the basket, somehow. I can
 
still recall the typical fragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the
 
elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not even care
 
 
to brush our teeth or wash our mouths properly. And why should
we? Who would take the trouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the
 
toothbrush? And why was it necessary at all?

Marriage gifts are meaningless without the sweet bread known as
 
the bol, just as a party or a feast loses its charm without bread. Not
 
 
enough can be said to show how important a baker can be for a
 
village. The lady of the house must prepare sandwiches on the
 
occasion of her daughter’s engagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a
 
 
must for Christmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the presence of
 
 
the baker’s furnace in the village is absolutely essential. 
 
Feast- a large meal, typically a celebratory one 
bolinhas - another name for coconut cookies 
 
The baker or bread-seller of those days had a peculiar dress known
 
as the kabai. It was a single piece long frock reaching down to the
 
knees. In our childhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and trousers
 
 
which were shorter than full-length ones and longer than half pants.
 
Even today, anyone who wears a half pant which reaches just below
 
 
the knees invites the comment that he is dressed like a pader!

Baking was indeed a profitable profession in the old days. The
 
 
 
baker and his family never starved. He, his family and his servants
always looked happy and prosperous. Their plump physique was an
 
open testimony to this. Even today any person with a jackfruit-like
 
physical appearance is easily compared to a baker.

The lesson begins with how the narrator's elders often recall
 
 
the time when Goa was under the rule of the Portuguese. They
 
 
talk about how the importance of bakers is still maintained in
 
 
 
their villages even after the Portuguese have left. They are
in Goa. The mixers, moulders and their
known as ‘Paders’
 
 
time-tested furnaces continue to serve the people of Goa with
 
 
their famous bread loaves. It is possible that the original ones
 
may not exist, but their profession is being continued by their
 
 
sons. The thud of their bamboo stick can still be heard in some
parts of the village. The same jingling thud would wake the
 
 
narrator and his friends during their childhood days who would
 
go running to him without brushing or washing their mouth
 
It was the maid-servant of the house who collected
properly.
 
 
 
the loaves while children sorted out the bread bangles for
 
 
themselves. Bakery products have importance in the culture
 
and traditions of Goa. Bol or sweet bread is a part of marriage
 
gifts, cakes and Bolinhas or coconut cookies are eaten at every
 
 
festival and the lady of the house prepares sandwiches at her
daughter’s engagement. Earlier bakers wore a unique frock of
 
knee-length known as ‘kabai’ but during the narrator’s
 
childhood days, they wore a shirt and trousers of length slightly
 
 
shorter than the usual ones. They generally collected their bills
 
at the end of every month. Bakery has continued to be a
profitable profession, managing to keep their families joyous
 
and prosperous.

past and tell them that though the Portuguese have left Goa but the 
bakers still exist, if not the original ones, their legacy is being 
continued by their sons. 
  
Q2. Is bread-making still popular in Goa? How do you know? 
A. Yes, bread-making is still popular in the city of Goa. It is evident 
from the existence of time-tested furnaces, mixers and moulders.

a bakery in every Goan village as bread is an important part of the 
Goan culture. 
  
Q3. What is the baker called? 
A. The baker is referred to as ‘Pader’ in the city of Goa. 
  
Q4. When would the baker come everyday? Why did the children run 
to meet him? 
A. The baker would come twice every day during the narrator’s 
childhood days. Once in the morning to deliver the loaves of bread 
and secondly, in the evening on his return after selling his stock. 

The children would go running to him to take the special bread 
bangles he had made for them.
